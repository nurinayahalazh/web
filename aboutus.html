				<div class="boxKiri">
					<p>With a humble beginning of a comment section and forum, Female Daily community - with members 
						that were considered to be early beauty adopters - grew into one of the biggest women-centered
						community in Indonesia. It then evolved into the first beauty review platform in Indonesia, 
						establishing itself as top-of-mind in beauty.</p>
					<p><br>In 2017 Female Daily brought the community, brands and other beauty players together in 
						JakartaXBeauty with a staggering 15.000+ visitors, further solidifying its position at the 
						forefront in beauty. 2020 marked another milestone as Female Daily Studio was launched,completing the cycle</p>

				<div class="boxKanan">
					<p><br>The community has since grown into a powerhouse of 1.000.000+ members and 2.000.000 annual users (as of 2022), 
						spanning all across Indonesia and abroad.</p>
					<p><br>Today, Female Daily offers a 360 beauty experience: beauty review platform, editorial content, community 
						engagement through FD Talk and events, and FD Studio commerce.</p>
